# Grabcut-3D


A Codebase that takes in NormalMap and segments RGBD data using the GrabCut algorithm. It uses the principle of Source, Sink to perform segmentation based on iterative graph cut. With Foreground, Background and Unknown labels the algorithm is able to segment into foreground and background regions once it receives contraints in the form of Pixel marking schemes.
